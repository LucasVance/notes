synesthesia: using words from two different senses to describe something

why is the author putting in effort to combine the senses?  
what senses are being combined?  
what individual descriptive words are being used  
how does the thing, the senses, and the diction contribute to the theme

what's the impact on story?

### structure of story
where does it start/end?  
what is dramatized/summarized?

### narrator distance
how involved is narrator in story?
is there bias that shapes the account?
third person - does the author intrude on

# how to find a theme
1. identify the conflict in the selection
2. identify resolution
3. make this conflict/resolution universal
   1. what are the ideas surrounding the conflict? the resolution?
   2. look for singular, abstract words
4. establish a relationship between these ideas in a complete sentence
   1. no character
   2. no specific events
   3. (author) writes (title) in order to illustrate that (universal idea) (message about the idea that is true for most, if not all, people)

**anaphora**: the exact repitition of words or phrases at the beginning of successive lines or sentences

**epistrophe**: same thing but at the end

**diction**: the author's word choice. powerful diction choices can build images, create a specific tone, or carry a strong connotation

**imagery**: language that appeals to the senses. goes beyond simple description by building a sensory image

### meter: basic rhythmic structure
older poetry meter often not significant, just how poetry was written

what it does
* helps establish the tone of poem
* formal structure - reinforce or contrast subject/theme
* focuses attention on certain words or lines
  * sudden changes of meter

what it doesn't do
* create a "flow"
* make a nice "sing song" effect
  * "soothing," "repetitive," "childlike"
  * link to tone -> theme


### Simile in Harlem by Langston Hughes
* Raising in sun - dried up, once was good, now done
* festering sore with pus - infected/poisoning, only harming me
* stinking rotten meat - smell goes everywhere, not good
* crusty sugary sweet - once good, buildup
* sags like heavy load - weighs us down, prevents movement
* exploding thing - violent: this one is different because it harms everybody

racial component of this - harlem is a place where people's dreams were deferred - this poem is about what happens to deferred dreams

**direct metaphor**: comparison of two unlike things where one is made equivalent to the other  
**implied metaphor**: when something in the text is indirectly made equivalent to something else. The reader must infer the comparison.

### Next, Please by Philip Larkin
 
the ship of promises looks nice
but never anchors and it's slow
POV is waiting at a bluff with disappointing flowers

ship of death
no life behind the black ship, no wake
this comes after everything else, finality of death

overall theme is **the only future we are guaranteed is death**

explain that there are two primary contrasting metaphors  
must compare the two ships
